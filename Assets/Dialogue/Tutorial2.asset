  dialogue:
  - a giant creature can be found in the largest of rooms. these creatures have learned
    how to use firearms and summon their own kind.
  - in order to beat these foes, you must be able to dodge barrages of bullets and
    to multitask.
  - i recommend that you are constantly on the lookout for improved guns to assist
    you in these fights.
  - after each fight, the door that was guarded by the creature will lead you deeper
    into the city.
  - my men will not follow you into these fights however. these are yours to deal
    with.
  - the door will only open once you clear all enemies and rescue all of my men.
    you can check your progress on the sidepanel.
  - oh, i nearly forgot. you can save your status at any blue campfire so if you
    happen to... have an accident. you come back.
  - good luck!
