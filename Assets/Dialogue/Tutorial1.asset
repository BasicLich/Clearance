    to shoot up to two weapons.

    the city. make good use of these, and be mindful of their limited ammo.
  - as per your agreement you will be tasked with clearing all hostiles. upon completion
    of this task you will be rewarded as discussed.
  - the city and its leftover resources are completely at your disposal.
  - whenever you see a military zone, people dressed like him over there will fill
    up all of your ammo and health.
  - oh, and if you meet any of my men out there feel free to help them. as thanks
    they will assist you in fighting the hostiles.
  - however they will only refill your resources once. so use their resources wisely!
  - keep an eye out for things to help you along the way and make sure to watch your
    back.
