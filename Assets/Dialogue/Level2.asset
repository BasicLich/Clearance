  dialogue:
  - this is a very busy part of town, especially that shopping centre and warehouse.
  - there are a good number of houses and alleyways too, so look out for enemies
    hiding in those.
  - oh, and before i forget, a lot of gunfire has been heard around here, so be careful!
  - good luck!
