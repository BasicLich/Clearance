  dialogue:
  - this is a very densely packed area so the enemies will be very close by. be careful!
  - the flat will have many rooms however the real danger is the large warehouse
    across the road. i heard there are a lot of explosive barrels in there!
  - this is one of our hardest hit lines. clearing this will be a massive relief
    to our resources and men! you will see the line as you head towards the bottom
    sector.
  - good luck!
